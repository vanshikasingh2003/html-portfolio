<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! I am Vanshika and I'm an aspiring web developer.  I love working on the web and making sure it continues to be a place for everyone and our creative, personal, and weird passions.</p>

<p>I love to experiment with the web as a creative medium. This here portfolio will change each year in pursuit of learning and using web technology in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>My biggest hobby is learning new things and combining a bunch of them into something new and creative.</p>
